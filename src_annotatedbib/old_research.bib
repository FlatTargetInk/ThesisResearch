In particular, they go into detail with the TrEPS (Traffic Estimation and Prediction System), and the security implications of such a system. Based these implications, a trust model is proposed to mitigate issues from invalid or malicious data. In this model, trust is broken down to data trust and node trust.},

	annote = {The authors propose a dual key management technique to broadcast information from TAs (Trusted Authorities) to authenticated vehicles, as well as between authenticated vehicles. The TAs generate two group keys for two types of users, primary and secondary. Computation cost of key changes is minimized by doing a simple addition or subtraction to update they key, and the users only need to perform a modulus function. The computational complexity of the management scheme is kept to constant time. Their system model includes TAs that provide keys and managed by states, RSUs (Road Side Units) which are controlled by the TAs and interface the vehicles and the TAs, and the vehicles, which contain an OBU (On Board Unit). The OBU interfaces with various devices, including vehicle sensors, a smart card device, and a fingerprint device. Possible attacks include a message replay attack, sybil attack, masquerading, message alteration, and collusion attack. Authentication is provided by the smart card and fingerprint and is authenticated by the TA verifying the Hash Code generated by the vehicle. The authors propose three user groups: primary, secondary, and unauthorized. The primary user group is the only group to have true access to TAs and RSUs; secondary user information only comes from primary users.}
