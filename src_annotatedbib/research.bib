	annote = {Li and Song first define many aspects of a VANET (Vehicular Ad-Hoc NETwork), including V2V communication (Vehicle to Vehicle) and V2I communication (Vehicle to Infrastructure). In particular, they go into detail with the TrEPS (Traffic Estimation and Prediction System), and the security implications of such a system. Based these implications, a trust model is proposed to mitigate issues from invalid or malicious data. In this model, trust is broken down to data trust and node trust.},
