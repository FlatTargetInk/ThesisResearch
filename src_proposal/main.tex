\section{Background}{\sechint{One paragraph (1/3 page) to orient the reader to the area of research.}}

V2V (Vehicle to Vehicle) communications allow vehicles to communicate with each other. A VANET (Vehicular Ad-Hoc NETwork) will open up communication channels, allowing helpful information to be passed between vehicles, alerting drivers of possible hazards or even adjusting routes to minimize travel time. This network will be possible with V2V (Vehicle to Vehicle) and V2I (Vehicle to Infrastructure) communication. V2V communication allows vehicles to pass information, such as speed and nearby dangers, between each other. V2I communication allows vehicles to communicate with an infrastructure that may provide extra benefits to a VANET. SCMS (Secure Credential Management System) aims to combine V2V and V2I to effectively transmit accurate traffic information between vehicles. IEEE Standard 1609.2 defines secure messaging formats for use by WAVE (Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments) devices.

While helpful information can be passed, nodes may act selfishly and not pass information as they should, and malicious information can even be passed instead, causing effects ranging from traffic problems to causing accidents. In order to reduce the effects of misbehaving nodes, communication needs to be secured and the source needs to be verified. SCMS is a V-PKI (Vehicular Public Key Infrastructure) which aims to implement all requirements of C.I.A. (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability). Confidentiality will be implemented by preserving the privacy of the driver. This will be accomplished by frequently changing certificates. Integrity will be implemented by its design, which includes features to encrypt and sign messages, and manage vehicle certificates. Managing certificates involves issuing certificates to valid vehicles and revoking existing certificates of misbehaving vehicles. Availability can be looked at in a few forms: maintaining low enough overhead to still provide a functional VANET, remain functioning during attacks, and rejecting as few legitimate users as possible.

\section{Problem Statement}{\sechint{One or two sentences that concisely state the problem that will be addressed by the research.}}

One proposed method to exchange keys in a V-PKI environment is SCMS. The complexity of V-PKI makes SCMS needed to be validated to be an effective infrastructure.
As vehicles become more connected and cars become more autonomous

\section{Technical Discussion}{\sechint{About one page that presents some of the more important aspects of the proposed research. This should include a summary of the state-of-the-art in the particular research area.}}

Asymmetric keys provide an excellent way to encrypt, decrypt, and sign messages using keys that are easy to distribute. Existing PKI's (Public Key Infrastructure) provide an excellent method of distributing keys without introducing new vulnerabilities. The special nature of vehicles (ie. dynamic movement) making existing PKI's not ideal for VANETs.

\subsection{Technical Challenges}
Unlike most networks where devices are stationary, devices in a VANET move at high speeds, and in different directions. This dynamic nature means that devices may be neighbors for some distance, or for just a moment \autocite{CommPatterns}. This nature also causes a Doppler shift, requiring the communication devices need to tolerate changes in frequency. The environment itself presents difficulties, such as reflections from buildings or even other vehicles, particularly vehicles that are not part of a VANET.

\subsection{Security Vulnerabilities}
A VANET has potential for security vulnerabilities. The most significant being the possibility of a malicious or malfunctioning vehicle transmitting false data. This poses a concern because it degrades the VANET's purpose of increasing driver (or driverless car) awareness of surroundings. There are many different types of attacks that fall under this issue, ranging from simply injecting bogus information to falsifying a vehicles location to adjust how data is routed to disrupt service. Another major vulnerability is privacy. In order to verify data comes from a valid source, the sender needs to be authenticated, however this poses a privacy issue.

\section{Approach}{\sechint{One paragraph (1/3 page) that describes the methods that will be applied in conducting the research.}}

Simulation software will be used to validate SCMS's effectiveness.
The software that will be used is Veins (version 4.6), OMNet++ (version 5.1-2), and Sumo (version 0.30.0-1). OMNet++ is a network simulator that will be used to simulate the protocol and network stacks. This is where most of the V-PKI under test will be implemented. Veins will be used to simulate cars on a road system. This adds the complexity of moving cars in different directions and adds traffic scenarios. To tie the two together, Sumo will be used.
